"""
Write a function that takes a string as an argument and returns that string 
with a staggered capitalization scheme. Every other character, starting from 
the first, should be capitalized and should be followed by a lowercase or 
non-alphabetic character. Non-alphabetic characters should not be changed, but 
should be counted as characters for determining when to switch between upper 
and lower case.
